  <h1>Weekend Timeline</h1>

  <h2>Friday, 8/2/19 - Welcome Party</h2>
  <h3>9:00-11:00 pm at <a href="https://oxbowbeer.com/location/portland/">Oxbow Blending and Bottling</a> in Portland, Maine</h3>

  <p>In the area? We'd love to see you and kick off the weekend. Join us for a
    casual drink and meet other folks in town for the wedding. We'll have a
    section of the taproom reserved, so come on by.
  </p>

  <h2>Saturday, 8/3/19 - Ceremony and Reception</h2>
  <h3>4:30 pm in Gray, Maine</h3>
  <h3>Dinner and reception to follow</h3>
  <h3>Cocktail attire</h3>

  <p>We're so excited to celebrate and share Maine with you! Maine is special
  to both of us - we met there and continue to go back for its outdoors, local food
  culture and relaxed atmosphere. Please keep in mind that the evening's festivities
  will be held primarily outdoors (rain or shine).

  <h2>Logistics</h2>

  <p>We recommend staying in Portland! The Old Port is easily walkable and full
  of great restaurants, breweries and other things to do. We don't have a reserved
  room block but there are lots of hotels and AirBnBs in the area. We'll be running a
  shuttle between the Old Port and the wedding venue on Saturday. If you're thinking
  of taking the shuttle, please help us plan by filling out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/BfiXClU5o7WgSzzN2">this
  questionaire</a>.
  </p>

  <p>We've heard that there are going to be a few <a href="http://www.beach2beacon.org/">other events</a>
  in town that weekend, so we recommend booking your accommodations well in advance.
  Freeport (just up the road) is also lovely and may be less busy. We're considering
  running a second shuttle, so please share your plans with us as they come together!
  We have a reserved room block at the <a href="https://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/maine/hampton-inn-freeport-brunswick-PWMFPHX/index.html">Hampton Inn in Freeport</a>.</p>

  <h2>More details to come...</h2>

  <p>Please check back closer to the day-of for more information!</p>
