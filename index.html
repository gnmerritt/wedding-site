  <p>We're so excited to celebrate and share Maine with you! Maine is special

  <h2>Logistics</h2>

  <p>We recommend staying in Portland! The Old Port is easily walkable and full
  of great restaurants, breweries and other things to do. We don't have a reserved
  room block but there are lots of hotels and AirBnBs in the area. We'll be running a
  shuttle between the Old Port and the wedding venue on Saturday. If you're thinking
  of taking the shuttle, please help us plan by filling out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/BfiXClU5o7WgSzzN2">this
  questionaire</a>.
  </p>

  <p>We've heard that there are going to be a few <a href="http://www.beach2beacon.org/">other events</a>
  in town that weekend, so we recommend booking your accommodations well in advance.
  Freeport (just up the road) is also lovely and may be less busy. We're considering
  running a second shuttle, so please share your plans with us as they come together!
  We have a reserved room block at the <a href="https://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/maine/hampton-inn-freeport-brunswick-PWMFPHX/index.html">Hampton Inn in Freeport</a>.</p>

  <h2>More details to come...</h2>

  <p>Please check back closer to the day-of for more information!</p>
